Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done"
"The brightest flame burns quickest"
That's what I heard her say
A son's heart sowed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow

Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Yeah, still

Rebel, mind your last name
Wild blood in my veins
They bring strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave
So let this heart be still
